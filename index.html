   <p>This dark and twisted realm is an effigy to the life and times of an aspiring artist known to the mortal realm as Tom.
    He was born and raised in the humble township of Alameda, located in the East Bay region of California. This upbringing has
    in turn influenced almost every aspect of his life, and tempered his feeble soul from a meek peasant into the astounding
    technological wizard you now see before you. From casting spells of wakening before early mornings of high school, to invoking high
    level necromantic enchantments, he continues his never ending quest for knowledge and glory in the 
    hallowed halls of higher education- and carries on his wish of obtaining a Bachelors of Science in the field of Visual Communication.
    
    Outside of education and the pursuit of arcane knowledge, he enjoys many frivolous pastimes, including the consumption of various crude forms
    of entertainment such as movies, comic books, video games and music. Out of all of these, music occupies the most prevalent parts of his mind,
    and he has considered starting a band to channel his love of the medium. It seems he is perhaps the most happy partaking in the ritual of observing
    music being created before an audience of thralls who give themselves willingly and sometimes violently to the rhythmic sensations, known to some as 
    a mosh pit. Perhaps, this is the most effective way to accrue hapless subjects in order to subject them to experimental and wild magic. 

    Now this Tom can regularly be found sequestered in his imposing tower, where he looks out over what will one day surely be his domain. Other than that,
    he is sometimes seen exchanging drinks and merriment while partaking in another strange ritual involving odd tomes and polyhedral probabability solids, which
    spurs some strange souls to spontaneously entertain the possibility of another world, a world of monsters, heroes, dungeons and dragons. 
    
    One day, he will hopefully achieve his greatest ambitions, love and happiness.
